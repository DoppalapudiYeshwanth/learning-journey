    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> I am pursuing an Undergraduate Course in Computer Science Engineering from ADYPSOE, Pune.
        Passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I thrive at the intersection of technology, innovation, and problem-solving. With expertise in TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, SQL, and Java, I specialize in building intelligent systems that drive efficiency and decision-making.
        I have interned as a Transformative AI Intern with AICTE, where I gained hands-on experience in cutting-edge AI applications. Additionally, I have worked on developing AI-powered medical diagnostics, leveraging machine learning to enhance healthcare solutions and improve patient outcomes.
        Beyond AI/ML, I have a strong foundation in web development, crafting dynamic and scalable solutions. My certifications in AI/ML reinforce my commitment to continuous learning and staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
        As a technology enthusiast, I am always eager to explore the latest advancements in AI, software development, and emerging trends. Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling to new places, experiencing diverse cultures, and immersing myself in books that broaden my perspective.
        Let's connect and explore opportunities to innovate, collaborate, and shape the future of technology together!
